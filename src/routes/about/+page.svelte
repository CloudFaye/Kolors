    <p>
      Pronounced 'colors', Kolors is a creative playground for exploring and comparing color systems
      from top design frameworks and iconic brand palettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Color is a fundamental aspect of design. Major brands and design systems have carefully crafted their color
      palettes to express their identity and ensure accessibility across various platforms. By bringing these 
      systems together, it's easier to see common patterns between different brand colors and general accessible colors in use.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a carefully curated list of color systems, featuring brands with products and digital experiences that serve millions of users.
      Also included are brands that may be less well-known but have unique and interesting color palettes.
