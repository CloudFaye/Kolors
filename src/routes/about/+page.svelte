		<p>
			Pronounced 'colors', Kolors is a creative playground for exploring and comparing color systems
			from top design frameworks and iconic brand palettes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Color is a fundamental aspect of design. Major brands and design systems have carefully
			crafted their color palettes to express their identity and ensure accessibility across various
			platforms. By bringing these systems together, it's easier to see common patterns between
			different brand colors and general accessible colors in use.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a carefully curated list of color systems, featuring brands with products and digital
			experiences that serve millions of users. Also included are brands that may be less well-known
			but have unique and interesting color palettes.
