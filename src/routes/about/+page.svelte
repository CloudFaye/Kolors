    <h2>Kolors?</h2>
    <p>
      Pronounced 'colors' is designed to help designers, developers, and creatives explore and compare color systems
      from popular design systems and brand guidelines. Our goal is to provide a clean, intuitive interface for
      accessing these color palettes in one place. <br><br>

       Color is a fundamental aspect of design. Major brands and design systems have carefully crafted their color
      palettes to express their identity and ensure accessibility across various platforms. By bringing these 
      systems together, it's easier to see common patterns between different brand colors and general accessible colors in use. 
      This list is carefully curated, all the brands featured have products and digital experience that serves millions of users.
      This list also features brands that are not well known, but have a unique and interesting color palette.
